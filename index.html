<p>
The sexual revolution in the United States was responsible for  profound changes in sexual and family behaviors.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>How did the social and moral values and public legislation change so quickly 
      from support for stable family relationships to sexual license and family 
      dissolution?</li>
  <li>What influences encouraged or resisted these changes?</li>
  <li>What were the consequences for individuals and for society?</li>
  <li>How did these changes affect traditional religious values and practices?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
At the end of the millenium, religious groups encountered political struggles
internally within their  own organizations and within the larger society in
their support of traditional religious values.
</p>
<p>
"Wrestling With Angels" documents the challenges to traditional religious sexual
and family behaviors and describes responses to changes within Judeo/Christian
communities.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie L. Coppock contends that both the universities and religious organizations
need to engage in serious discussion and consideration in regard to changing sexual
behaviors and family patterns and the consequences of the directions in which we
are moving.

  <b>Praise for Wrestling With Angels</b>
  <ul>
  <li type="star">"Wrestling With Angels is very helpful in its analysis of the impact
                  of the sexual revolution on our culture, particularly in its relation
                  to the church.  It is a much needed study."<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Dr. D. James Kennedy<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President, Coral Ridge Ministries<br>
                  &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li type="star">"A major contribution  to the study of the relationship between religion
                  and society.  It provides a much needed perspective on this interface.
                  The chapters on family breakdown and the culture wars make it
                  particularly valuable for use in courses on marriage and the family."<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Dr. William Alex McIntosh<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor of Sociology, Texas A&M University at College Station<br>
                  &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li type="star">"Exactly what the world needs today, a concise examination told in a
                  compelling way that reminds us of our direction and purpose as the church."<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Rev. Bob Allen<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Pastor of Coker United Methodist Church, San Antonio, Texas<br>
                  &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li type="star">"Eye-opening and thought provoking.  It presents succinct research
                  documentation that provides another tool in support of marriage and
                  intact families.  This book is both timely and needed.  I plan to give it
                  as a wedding gift.  It is a book that every Christian family should read
                  and discuss."<br>

                  &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li type="star">"A very well researched piece of work from which I learned a lot.  The book
                  is chock full of interesting and useful information."<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Dr. Norval D. Glenn<br>

                  &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li type="star">"A thorough and scholarly examination of the social and cultural impact
                  of the sexual revolution in the United States,  particularly as it impacts
                  the church. It is a groundbreaking study that will be an essential source
                  in this discussion for some time to come."<br>
